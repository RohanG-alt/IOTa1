<h1>Project idea</h1>

<h3>What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</h3> 

<p>I am passionate about nature, animals and biology. An interesting Technology innovation that would be cool to see is a carbon capture machine. I believe this project of developing a Website to promote sustainability. Would help me develop the appropriate tech skills such as coding and personal skills through group work. This would help me progress to my ideal job which is a web developer. </p> 

<h3>
Overview 
</h3> 
<p>My indented project will be a global tree tracker which calculates the population of trees at any given moment. The project will encompass a simple design UI based on principles I have learnt In UCD class such as usability and aesthetics so that all ages of users can extract the information.  The user will be able to quickly check the number of trees around the world based on an estimation of the population. The project will be like live human population counters however will be directed at trees. </p> 
<h3>Motivation </h3> 
<p>
My motivation for this project comes from a variety of sources such as statistics e.g., there are “3.04 trillion trees” on earth (GoTreeQoutes 2020) reference (1) and “15 billion trees are cut down each year” (nature 2 Sep 2015). Reference (2). These statistics interest me as I or many people may not think about these mind-blowing statistics regularly, especially considering that trees produce a lot of oxygen which is essential to humanities survival. Another source of motivation includes the potential importance of this project e.g. The global concerns and movements regarding climate concerns, this website could help give these groups an idea of deforestation on a current basis. Or potentially persuade others to think twice about their consumer behaviour and environmental impacts. Lastly, my concerns about the scarcity of materials such as wood not being available to future generations have prompted me to develop this project for people to source more sustainable resources. </p> 
<h3> Description </h3> 
<p>The websites main feature would be the live counter of tree population for elapsed times e.g., years, months, weeks, minutes, seconds This feature is intended to be the most used by all categories of people, therefore has a simple and limited design. the other features of the website include. Charts such as historical tree count over the past years. This gives the user better insight and adds meaning to the current live count and the intended users are mostly experts in the environmental field, such as geographers, climatologist. Therefore, the design has complexed features such as scaled and detailed infographics. A map which highlights tree population over the globe for certain countries, oxygen provided by trees per person and other relevant charts. (this may be a static image, or an interactive chart sourced from a statistics site, Like the charts this feature is intended for expert users. Therefore, has a complex feature such as scientific language. A basic comment system e.g., Jetpack where users can share their thoughts about the information presented, interact with other users through upvote/downvote or replies. Or a live comment system that allows for interaction in real-time. The purpose of the communication features much like social media sites is to allow the users to engage the topic by expressing their ideas or asking questions, developing connections based on mutual interest, get people to come back via push notifications etc. Other possible features include blog posts that give further details about trees e.g., information about deforestation, alternatives material sources other than wood etc. This feature is generally intended for all types of users. And serves the purpose of educating people about the topic or sparking their interest to act and SEO of course. A tab where the user can engage with the issue such as through challenges which promotion sustainability e.g., day 1 find alternative use less paper today, day 2 find other tools to start a flame other than matches etc. This feature is intended to be used by all ages. Therefore, the tasks are generally simple but effective towards the end goal of sustainable practice. This feature can be further enhanced like a game system, where the users are rewarded with a digital token after completing a certain number of tasks. Another visible feature of the product is going to be the UI of the product. The user interface will be designed simplistically. The tracker is at the front of the page for the users who want to quickly retrieve the information, upon scrolling down the advanced features such as the charts and maps are displayed for the expert users, then the recent or most popular blog post, the chat system all other pages are listed on the header. At the top, a header with the relevant tabs is displayed with a search bar. An accounting system may be implemented in future updates if necessary, based on the number of site users. Finally, a feedback form at the bottom so the user can report any errors or request a feature. </p> 
<h3>Tools and technology </h3> 
<p>
The tools and software required for this website vary depending on the features. For example, the UI can be designed through software such as adobe illustrator, Pre-designed graphics can be extracted from sites such as Canva. Features such as the chat systems can be implemented from a plugin such as Jetpack. Graphics and charts can be sourced from sites such as statista.com. The website domain and hosting can be implemented through sites such as domain.com. A code editing platform such as a Microsoft visual studio would be useful. In terms of hardware not much computing power is required so any computer could complete the task. </p> 
<h3>
Skills required </h3> 
<p>
Basic Html, CSS and java scripts to write certain code e.g., to implement the count-down timer with the appropriate fonts. And to modify certain plug-in features of the website based on the needs of the site. In terms of accessing the software, it is quite feasible through Ms visual studio. The coding skills are not to complex and could be quickly attained through research and online tutorials, although modifying plug-ins may present a challenge. When it comes to UI design software such as adobe illustrator it is also easy to access, the UI skills from the User-centred design classes, can be used in this project. Plugins such as Jetpack would require a couple of hours to properly implement. The overall cost is quite feasible as the main components of the site is built from scratch code.</p> 
<h3>Outcome </h3> 
<p>
If the project is successful, the outcome will be a simply designed website that counts trees. And educates people about trees. The general problem about people not being aware or thinking about the presence and importance of trees would be mitigated to a small extent. For example, the counter makes people think about the declining population of trees. Or at least raise awareness about the problem and prompt people to find better alternatives. The impact of this project would be to not replace the use of trees but encourage people to think twice about the effects of deforestation and then for them to decide to do whatever they want with the information presented. </p>
