<h1>Interest in IT </h1>
<h3> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
<p>
My interests in Information technology ranges from broad topics such as the structure internal and external of computers and how they function. E.g., The hard drives interacting with the CPU and keyboards being used to input characters. I am also interested in the internal functions of computers such as how code can be written, compiled into machine code and get the computer to do a certain task, basic programming. This interest for me had begun when I got my first computer around 10 years ago and was amazed at its usefulness. Another IT interest for me includes robotics such as personal home robots e.g., robot vacuums, Sophia the AI robot, Honda ASIMO etc. I am also interested in robotic limbs such as bionic hands. My interest in robotics was from my admiration of Tony Stark from the Avengers.

<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3> 
<p> I chose RMIT for multiple aspects such as many IT facilities such as the 3d printing area, High functioning computers etc. Upon researching the course structure of Bachelor of Information technology I had found that there was a vast number of chose from minors and majors to choose from which got my interest. Another factor includes the methods of learning from the subjects such as the blend of lectures and practicals gives the student, a good overview of the topic. Other factors for choosing RMIT include Friends, family current students recommending RMIT, the fast printing and WIFI and helpful staff. </p> 
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3> 
<p> I expect to learn mostly Information technology related stuff, such as programming, designing systems, data, AI etc. Other than that, I expect to learn skills such as Networking, pitching, group work and other skills which will make me more efficient in doing my tasks and job. </p>
